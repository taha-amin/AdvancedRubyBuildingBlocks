Project 1: Bubble Sort

Sorting algorithms are some of the earliest that you typicavally get exposed to in Computer Science. It may
not be immediately obvious how important they are, but it shouldn't be hard to think of some examples where
your computer needs to sort some massive datasets during every operations.

One of the simpler (but more processor-intensive) ways of sorting a group of items in an array is bubble sort,
where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than
the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.

ASSIGNMENT:
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

Project 2: Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop...all the conditions that
make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound Object Oriented Programming sea legs.

Assignment: 
Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where 2 human players can play against each other and the board is displayed
in between turns.
